# DiigoToDelicious
Hacky tool I wrote to take my Diigo bookmarks and move them back into my Delicious account, without duplicates

Has no history because I forked it from my local git repo and removed all the hard-coded values I have that are tied to my account.

I wouldn't call this complete, but it will definitely give started code for someone who wants to write a tool that auths and talks to delicious.
